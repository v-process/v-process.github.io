-Dalai Lama

My name is **Hossain Mohd. Faysal**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am an MSc + PhD candidate in *Electrical Engineering* at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/) at **University of Pennsylvania**. I am licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.E) to practice in the states of Texas, Massachusetts and California. I graduated with a B.Sc degree in EECS from Texas A&M University in 2011 and with a B.Sc degree in Mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2012, and currently focusing on Electrical Engineering for my post-graduate studies.

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, I hope to found a self-sustaining collective of clever people, for fun, profit(?), and the promotion of human life in the universe. This might wind up in Qatar, Bangladesh, Scandinavia, the Massachusetts Bay Area, the SF Bay Area, Japan, Germany, or the dustbin of overly idealistic plans. (Yes, I have a special bin for overly idealistic plans. In my district they can't be recycled with residential mixed paper.) The most challenging aspect of this concept is to curtail unproductive competition with other people who will inevitably have the same idea. (Some sort of cooperative federation...) I'm presently looking for people who might be interested in being a part of such an organization.

Anyways, for now I'm just working toward changing the face of Electrical Engineering forever. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.
